# My Rasterizer Project
An adventure through the world of vertices, pixels and texels.

## About
Rasterizer is an project created with the main aim of help-me during the reading of the classic 
book Computer Graphics Principles and Practice Second Edition, the main ideia is to implement the 
building block algorithms of the book in way I can grasp better the topics covered and also 
get a more practical knowledge of the methods that GPUs may implement on the metal today.

## The Posts 
The evolution of the project will be posted on my blog with the theory, implementation details 
and complete coverage of the algorithms used here.
See the posts [here](https://photonstopixels.wordpress.com/projects/).

May the force be with us all!
